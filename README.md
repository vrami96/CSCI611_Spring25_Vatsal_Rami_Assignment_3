# CSCI611 - Assignment 3: Small Object Detection Using YOLOv8

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project aims to detect **small objects**â€”specifically **traffic signs and lights**â€”using the **YOLOv8** object detection model. These objects, often small and distant in vehicle-mounted camera views, require special care during model training, such as higher resolution inputs and data augmentation strategies.
